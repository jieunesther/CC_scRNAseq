# CC_snRNAseq
This page contains information about the snRNAseq data generated from cerebral cortex (specifically, right cortical hemisphere) of the 14 collaborative cross mouse strains.
The scRNAseq data was generated using 92 animals from 14 different collaborative cross mouse strains to understand the influence of genetic background on brain cell type composition. We used Split Pool Ligation-based Transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq) for generating the snRNAseq data
