# CC_snRNAseq

## Data summary
This page contains information about the single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data generated from cerebral cortex (specifically, right cortical hemisphere) of the 14 collaborative cross mouse strains.
The scRNAseq data was generated using 92 animals from 14 different collaborative cross mouse strains to understand the influence of genetic background on brain cell type composition. We used Split Pool Ligation-based Transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq) for generating the snRNAseq data, which utilizes a combinatorial barcoding technique to identify the cellular origin of RNA during snRNAseq analysis. This repository includes metadata, barcode sequences used for SPLiT-seq, scripts to generate the process snRNAseq seurat data (.rds file).
